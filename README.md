# Kickstarter-Analysis

ANALYSIS OVERVIEW

The purpose of this analysis is to Isolate relevant information and to show the relationship between funding goals and Launch dates with successful play outcomes. The ultimate goal is to determine the best time of year and monetary goal to set to a play up for success.

ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES 

I am pretty good at excel, I use it daily at work but I did run into a few challenges. My first one was issued with converting to Unicode to date format. I used the Ask BCS in Slack for help. but this could have been avoided by reading through the module and taking better notes. The other obstacles were more due to attention to detail - I didn't split the category and sub-category at first and I left out the range 35000-39999- saw the mistake when my graph didn't look similar to the example and had to go back Another issue I had was adding the ranges- at first I thought it was a pivot table option but realized I would have o use the ‘IFS’ Function. the last issue I has was putting the ranges in the correct chronological order- for that, I used Dr. Google. 

RESULTS

There are a few conclusions that you can pull from the  Theater Outcomes by Launch Date graph. First, May has the highest number of successful theatre productions. Also, Theatre productions released in November- January has the least failed plays. Warmer weather launches tend to be more successful. The trendlines have a relationship – they rise and fall during the same months and seem to follow similar trends. The Outcomes based on Goals graph reveals that plays with funding goals under 1,000 tend to have the highest success rate. Additionally, the plays with goals under 20,000 had higher rates of success that higher budget productions.

LIMITATIONS

The limitations of this dataset are that Some ranges have small sample sizes such as 4 5000-49999. With only 1 play in this range that failed outcome really skews the graph. Maybe not a limitation but something that would provide more clarity is that I Should have added percentages in the theatre by the launch date because the number isn’t representative of the whole as the numbers increase

Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create would be a Bar graph comparing successful Plays in different countries. Also, a line graph comparing goals to pledge amounts of successful plays could be helpful to set funding expectations.
